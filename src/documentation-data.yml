Each piece of data in an array is identified by an index number representing its position in the array. The first element in the array is `[0]`, the second element is `[1]`, and so on. Arrays are similar to objects, so they must be created with the keyword `new`.\n\nEach array has a variable `length`, which is an integer value for the total number of elements in the array. Note that since index numbering begins at zero (not 1), the last value in an array with a `length` of 5 should be referenced as `array[4]` (that is, the `length` minus 1), not `array[5]`, which would trigger an error.\n\nAnother common source of confusion is the difference between using `length` to get the size of an array and `length()` to get the size of a String. Notice the presence of parentheses when working with Strings. (`array.length` is a variable, while `String.length()` is a method specific to the String class.)\n"

This is similar to making an array of objects, but with an `ArrayList`, items can be easily added and removed from the ArrayList and it is resized dynamically. This can be very convenient, but it's slower than making an array of objects when using many elements.  Note that for resizable lists of integers, floats, and Strings, you can use the Processing classes IntList, FloatList, and StringList.\n\nAn ArrayList is a resizable-array implementation of the Java List interface. It has many methods used to control and search its contents. For example, the length of the `ArrayList` is returned by its `size()` method, which is an integer value for the total number of elements in the list. An element is added to an `ArrayList` with the `add()` method and is deleted with the `remove()` method. The `get()` method returns the element at the specified position in the list.

The resulting value will always be between 0.0 and 1.0. Processing can compute 1D, 2D and 3D noise, depending on the number of coordinates given. The noise value can be animated by moving through the noise space, as demonstrated in the first example above. The 2nd and 3rd dimensions can also be interpreted as time.\n\nThe actual noise structure is similar to that of an audio signal, in respect to . . .",

This falloff amount can be changed by adding an additional function parameter. For example, a falloff factor of 0.75 means each octave will now have 75% impact (25% less) of the previous lower octave.
